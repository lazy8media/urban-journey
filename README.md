# urban-journey
A tool to aid bands to plan rehearsal and performances. The app will use the bands feelings about songs rehearsed and when a song was last played to give a recommended rehearsal list. The aim is to ensure all songs are rehearsed on a regular basis. Priority will be given to songs that are scheduled for a performance.
